## Abstract

In an era defined by the rapid evolution of wireless communication technolo- gies, LoRa (Long Range) has become a transformational force that is chang- ing the field of long-range, low-power communication. This technology holds immense potential for diverse applications within the Internet of Things (iot) environments. Unlike its competitors, LoRa’s technology has the ability in pro- viding range as well as minimizing power consumption. By the integration and confirmation of the effectiveness of LoRa’s technology in real life this project, “LoPy2LoPy“, this project emerges as an exploration into the core of LoRa’s communication. To address these challenges, it was used LoPy devices. In conclusion, the goal of LoPy2LoPy project is to perform experiences and tests to evaluate overall performance of LoRa technology, by addressing challenges like long range, low-power communication by providing a direct communication between the different LoPy devices. This project also aims on testing differ- ent environments, surfaces, communication scenarios, accounting for various disturbances (for example noise), and also to understand how factors such as frequency, bandwidth and spreading factor can affect communication, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the LoRa network’s adaptability and resilience.
